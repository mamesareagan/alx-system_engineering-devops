WEB INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESIGN

Over the span of a week, I dedicated myself to a project focused on delving into web infrastructure design. This involved a step-by-step exploration of various design principles, during which I documented my progress using whiteboard diagrams. I initiated the process with a simple LAMP model, and as the days progressed, I gradually shaped the design into a comprehensive, distributed system that boasted robust monitoring and top-notch security measures.

Throughout the project, I committed my research findings and creative ideas to visual representations on the whiteboard. Starting from the foundational LAMP setup, the diagrams meticulously showcased the evolution of the infrastructure. From initial sketches to final designs, each diagram served as a snapshot of the progress made, capturing the transition from a basic setup to a sophisticated distributed architecture.

At the project's conclusion, a collection of files emerged, each containing a direct link to a specific whiteboard diagram. These documents stand as a testament to my deepened comprehension of web infrastructure design, offering a visual narrative of the transformative journey undertaken over the course of the week.
